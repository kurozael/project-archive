	<p>
		<i>
			These are just guidelines, there is not a full rules list because there would be too many to list.
			Use these guidelines and your <b>common sense</b> and you should be able to play the game without
			suffering from a very long ban.
		</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<p>
			<b>1.</b> Do not say anything unnecessary, stupid or irrelavant in OOC.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>2.</b> Type properly and use correct grammar at all times to keep it professional and realistic.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>3.</b> If somebody breaks a rule it does not take seven of you to tell them, if one person
			tells them to go and read the guidelines, you do not need to back them up.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>4.</b> It is not your duty to become a vigilante, if somebody tries to prop-kill you or
			something similiar, you should disconnect and report it to an administrator. Trying to kill
			them yourself will only result in you being banned.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>5.</b> Do not kill another character without a good reason, and you must be able to prove
			to an administrator that you had a valid reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>6.</b> When your character is killed, you must follow the 'new life rule', that being you
			forget twenty four hours prior to your death.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>7.</b> Never take revenge on somebody that killed you, or randomly killed you, report them
			instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.</b> If you want to contact one person directly, do not use OOC, use the personal message
			command instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>9.</b> Do not powergame, this means you cannot force an action that other characters <i>must</i> abide
			by. Whether it's attacking a character, picking up an item, or tying a character up you must always attempt to do
			so.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.</b> The roll command is not to be used to settle powergaming, that must be settled out-of-character. The roll
			command is purely for gambling and other in-character situations.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>9.</b> If a character performs a valid action such as disarming your character and it is genuinly impossible
			for your character to do some matrix-move to prevent them, you must abide by it. It is only a weapon after all and
			survival is much more important in this environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>10.</b> If for example you are about to execute a character and that character's friend shoots you from a distance
			without being in range to perform an action, then that is valid and you must not complain about the kill being random.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>11.</b> Do not attempt to kill another character by using props, we have sufficient protection to prevent you from
			doing so, but if you do manage it we do have logs and it will result in a permanent ban.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>12.</b> Your physical description must be in full English. Valid examples are displayed in green, and invalid
			examples are displayed in red. See below for the examples.
			<br><br>
			<i>
				<font color="green">
					A black man with a beanie hat on.
					<br>
					A sixteen year old white female with brown hair.
					<br>
				</font>
				<font color="red">
					Black|Male|BeanieHat.
					<br>
					16|White|Female|BrownHair.
					<br>
				</font>
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>13.</b> You need to roleplay fear. Fear is a basic human emotion, if you are outnumbered and are being threatened
			to give up a posession, your character should (as almost any human would) show fear and give in to their demands. Unless
			you have a valid reason not to.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>14.</b> Have respect for the staff, they are here to make sure your playing experience is fun and enjoyable. We understand
			that sometimes our staff's judgement can be wrong, and if you believe that is so then please report it on the forums. If you do
			report an action made by our staff, be sure not to disrespect them in doing so.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>15.</b> The advertisement command must be used seriously, and not for out-of-character purposes. It must be used as if
			a person has read a sign, or a notice informing them of something.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>16.</b> All weapons including melee weapons like crowbars and baseball bats are always illegal. Combat and medic uniforms
			and almost everything on the blackmarket is permanently illegal and this is a law that cannot be changed by the president.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>17.</b> If you are a dispenser, and you are selling to the police. You may not scam, scamming in this situation will
			result in a blacklist and a demotion.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>18.</b> Do not kill another character unless you have a <i>very</i> good reason for doing so. When you kill someone you
			will expect a personal conversation with the staff for you to explain, in detail why you took their life. If we do not
			find the reason valid, you could face anything up to a permanant ban.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>19.</b> If you do kill someone for a very good reason, you should try not to do so in public. If you do kill someone in public
			or kill the police, you should expect to give an even more in-depth reason to the staff as to why you did that.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>20.</b> Do not do anything stupid or things that you wouldn't dare to do in real-life. You are not a super-hero, and neither is
			your character. If the staff tells you that you wouldn't do that in real-life, you accept it and do not do it, you do not reply back
			to them arguing that you would.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>21.</b> As the police, you are given a temporary weapon and some ammo. Do not abuse this, you should only shoot at a character
			if they are shooting you or threatening your life. If you do not follow this rule, you will most certainly be blacklisted, demoted
			and banned. Always try to arrest a character first.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>22.</b> Using voice chat for anything other than in-character talking, e.g: using it for out-of-character discussion or streaming
			music or whatever is not allowed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>23.</b> The police are allowed to randomly search any apartment or building for contraband items. Whining about it is no good, they are
			allowed to do it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>24.</b> If you are the police and you ask someone to step out of the vehicle, because the script has no way of letting you drag them out
			you can shoot them if they continue to refuse.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>25.</b> The secretaries and the president <i>need to abide by the law.</i> Weapons are only legal for the <i>police<i>. Secondly, the
			secretaries job is to take calls and make appointments for the president, not to be his or her personal bodyguard.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>26.</b> If you state that somebody is trying to kill you 'randomly' in OOC, or that somebody has killed you, nobody will listen. It is
			not intelligent, and is very ignorant, to assume that something is random just because <i>you are not aware of the reason.</i> When somebody
			is killed, the admins will privately investigate the killing and you do not need to get involved.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>27.</b> The president cannot change the guidelines, ever. For example a president cannot make a certain item legal, if the guidelines state
			that it is illegal. The president can also never 'let someone slide' if they are being arrested, if the police are arresting somebody the president
			has no say in it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>29.</b> The police can fine characters for commiting crimes instead of arresting them, if they wish, but if they can't pay it then you must
			arrest them. Whether you fine the character or not, you still need to tie them up and search them for illegal items.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>30.</b> Police that aren't doing their jobs, like blatently ignoring a criminal in the street, will be blacklisted and demoted. There is a difference
			between letting sombody slide, and blatently ignoring the crime all together and not doing anything about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>31.</b> Graffiti is illegal because spray cans are purchased from the black market. Anyone seen graffiting should be arrested.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>32.</b> Drugs sold by the Hustler class are always illegal. This, as all guidelines, cannot be altered by the active president. The police
			should perform regular raids on apartments for both money printers and drug labs.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>33.</b> If you are the police, and a character is commiting an offence but you are physically unable to reach them. Whether it be due to lack
			of an attribute that requires you to get there, or the character has blocked themselves somewhere, you are allowed to shoot them in the leg.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>34.</b> If you are the police, and you have managed to get a character to stand still and have begun the detainment process, you are allowed
			to fire upon them if they try to flee from you. You are <i>only allowed to shoot them if they run after you have begun detaining them.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>35.</b> As the police, you should always try to use the stunbaton where possible; and only use the sidearm as a last resort. Your
			number one priority should be to attempt to detain the suspect at all costs, and not to have them killed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>35.</b> If you are caught using a class to buy items for yourself, you will receive a hefty ban. You are allowed to buy a shipment
			and keep some of it, with the intent to sell the rest on. If you are Blackmarket, Merchant, Caterer, Hustler or Dispenser, you must
			own a business or a store (depending on the legality of the class).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>36.</b> As the police, you cannot change clothing and go undercover without the president's permission. You can do it ofcourse, but not
			legally. Doing so blatently in public without the president's permission would be idiotic and stupid.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>37.</b> Modifying your vehicles using ToolTrust is okay, but not to the extent where you're being really stupid with it. For example, placing
			saw blades and harpoons on your car is just rediculous.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>38.</b> Just to clarify, your reason for killing someone must be good. Killing a cop for arresting your friend is <i>not</i> a valid reason, you
			should wait until they're in jail and attempt to bust them out. Not get into a full-blown fire fight and murder a hundred policeman because of it.
