	<p>
		<i>
			These are just guidelines, there is not a full rules list because there would be too many to list.
			Use these guidelines and your <b>common sense</b> and you should be able to play the game without
			suffering from a very long ban.
		</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<p>
			<b>1.</b> Do not say anything unnecessary, stupid or irrelavant in OOC.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>2.</b> Type properly and use correct grammar at all times to keep it professional and realistic.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>3.</b> When taking an item, you must first attempt to take it using the action command.
			If nobody in your proximity counter-roleplays to prevent you from taking it, then you may
			continue to pick the item up.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>4.</b> If somebody breaks a rule it does not take seven of you to tell them, if one person
			tells them to go and read the guidelines, you do not need to back them up.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>5.</b> Do not constantly search for items, the chances are you will find <i>none.</i>
			Roleplay is not focused on items, but character development. There are not specific times that
			items will be dropped for you to scavenge, and there is not a specific interval either.
			Items are dropped when they are dropped, if we feel there is enough in circulation, then we
			will not drop any for a long time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>6.</b> It is not your duty to become a vigilante, if somebody tries to prop-kill you or
			something similiar, you should disconnect and report it to an administrator. Trying to kill
			them yourself will only result in you being banned.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>7.</b> Do not kill another character without a good reason, and you must be able to prove
			to an administrator that you had a valid reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>8.</b> When your character is killed, you must follow the 'new life rule', that being you
			forget twenty four hours prior to your death.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>9.</b> Never take revenge on somebody that killed you, or randomly killed you, report them
			instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>10.</b> If you want to contact one person directly, do not use OOC, use the personal message
			command instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>11.</b> The roleplay environment is survival based, not 'faction' based, so creating huge armies
			or 'factions' is disallowed. You are allowed to create small tent villages but not huge bases.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>12.</b> You should constantly be roleplaying the survival factor, that means you can't just walk
			from one end of the wasteland to the other with no water and energy. Believe it or not your character
			is actually human and does have basic needs like thirst and hunger.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>13.</b> When within range to perform an action, you must attempt or perform attacking another character
			whether it's via a melee or ranged weapon. This only applies if you are within the range for the other
			character to see the action.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>14.</b> Do not powergame, this means you cannot force an action that other characters <i>must</i> abide
			by. Whether it's attacking a character, picking up an item, or tying a character up you must always attempt to do
			so.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>15.</b> The roll command is not to be used to settle powergaming, that must be settled out-of-character. The roll
			command is purely for gambling and other in-character situations.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>16.</b> If a character performs a valid action such as disarming your character and it is genuinly impossible
			for your character to do some matrix-move to prevent them, you must abide by it. It is only a weapon after all and
			survival is much more important in this environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>17.</b> If for example you are about to execute a character and that character's friend shoots you from a distance
			without being in range to perform an action, then that is valid and you must not complain about the kill being random.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>18.</b> Do not attempt to kill another character by using props, we have sufficient protection to prevent you from
			doing so, but if you do manage it we do have logs and it will result in a permanent ban.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>19.</b> Your physical description must be in full English. Valid examples are displayed in green, and invalid
			examples are displayed in red. See below for the examples.
			<br><br>
			<i>
				<font color="green">
					A black man with a beanie hat on.
					<br>
					A sixteen year old white female with brown hair.
					<br>
				</font>
				<font color="red">
					Black|Male|BeanieHat.
					<br>
					16|White|Female|BrownHair.
					<br>
				</font>
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>19.</b> You need to roleplay fear. Fear is a basic human emotion, if you are outnumbered and are being threatened
			to give up a posession, your character should (as almost any human would) show fear and give in to their demands. Unless
			you have a valid reason not to.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>20.</b> Have respect for the staff, they are here to make sure your playing experience is fun and enjoyable. We understand
			that sometimes our staff's judgement can be wrong, and if you believe that is so then please report it on the forums. If you do
			report an action made by our staff, be sure not to disrespect them in doing so.
