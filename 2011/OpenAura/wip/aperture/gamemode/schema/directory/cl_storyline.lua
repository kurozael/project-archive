	<p>
		Aperture is set in the year 2023, whereby you the survivor of an Aperture Science test experiment that has
		gone terribly wrong. The world outside has collapsed and is completely destroyed and you - to your knowledge - are
		alone.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Before everything went pear-shaped, Aperture Science was testing a new drug to help give immortality to humans. They were
		testing it on <i>you.</i> Unfortunately, the last revision of the drug given to you has actually impaired your health, and
		currently the only way for you to stay alive is to take 'serums' created by Dr. Issac Cook, a recently deceased survivor.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The serums themselves have become a large part of life within the post-apocalyptic world you now live in, and are often seen
		as currency amongst survivors and the various guilds of the world. The serums themselves, contain the element 'Natex', which
		can be molded (with the right degree of skill in crafting) into almost any shape and then materialized into specific items.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Survivors have recently developed a new technology to produce Serums, which has led to the quick advancement of many other new
		technologies in the wasteland - including the development of 'Augments'. Augments are like permanent attachments to your body
		which allow you to perform in new ways, or improve an existing attribute. Some augments are permanent, where as some only work
		depending on your karma.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Karma can be gained by doing nice things in the world, or lost by doing bad things. For example, you can increase your karma
		by killing anybody with bad karma, but you can lose it by killing somebody with good karma. There are other ways to gain
		or lose karma too!
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Karma will often affect whether people trust you, they can see it in your eyes! So watch out, be safe, and happy surviving.
