// Using Who 

When a player types the who command they see a list of all Who modules to check on what people are doing

To create a function you do like below, returning true means that the player is doing this activity and
will show on the menu

// Example function

function SS.Who.Driving(Player)
	if (Player:InVehicle()) then
		return true
	end
	
	return false
end

SS.Who.Module("Driving", SS.Who.Driving)
