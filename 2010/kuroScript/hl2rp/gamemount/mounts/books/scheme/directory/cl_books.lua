			With HL2 RP, there are many different types or books, journals or newspaper articles that you can get a hold of.
			These can often provide an interesting read for your character, which ICly will give them knowledge. Remember, do not think
			of your character as you - sometimes you'll need to repeat the same things for each character to give them that same knowledge.
