			In HL2 RP you have the ability to write things down, to say make personal notes for yourself or leave them for others. To do so you must first have paper.
			You can buy paper from any merchant. Once you have the paper, go into your inventory, click on it and hit use. The paper will be dropped onto the ground.
			Look at the paper and press use to write on it, if paper has already been written on it cannot be written on again - but you can press use to read it.
