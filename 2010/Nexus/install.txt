[Installing a copy of nexus]
(If you already have nexus installed, follow upgrade.txt)

o Extract the files in this archive to just outside of your garrysmod/ directory and overwrite any existing files.
o When you put both nexus and <gamemode> in your gamemodes folder, you need to do sv_defaultgamemode <gamemode>.
o Then, you need to goto garrysmod/data/nexus/ and edit the mysql.cfg with your own MySQL database information.
o The final stage of the MySQL setup is to use the nexus.sql file to import the tables to your database.
o If you don't wish to use the titan networking system (although it is highly recommended to use titan) then
	remove the titan/ directory from garrysmod/addons/.
o You should be all set from there. Load up your server and enjoy. If you have anymore questions
	I have set your usergroup on the forums to 'Customer' and you can post in the help
	and support section of the Studio Sixteen products forum (this only applies to those who
	have purchases a schema).
o Please make sure you read the licence.txt file for information reguarding legal issues with
	the script. It will inform you that leaking, or editing the script beyond my wishes
	may result in legal action. This is not an empty threat.
	
A good idea is, if you can, to implement a user group called 'operator' in to the administration system you're using.
All top administration systems have the ability to add custom user groups for players, Exsto being one of my favourite.
The operator user group is used for some low-level restricted commands, like kicking a player. Although it isn't necessary
to have this user group exist, it may be handy for administration purposes so you are able to give somebody a small
position in the staff.
